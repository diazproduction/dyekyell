# Dÿkÿll

This is just a fun project in which I'll combine two of the things I like the most: human languages and storytelling with the areas I work with: design and software development.

## What is Dÿkÿll?

Dÿkÿll, also spelled as Tügüll (or Dyekyell/Tueguel, respectively, in ASCII), is a fictitious language with its own people, script and grammar. This repository will contain several small projects all with the objective of helping me develop the language and the culture of its people, but also as a mean for me to try new web technologies, frameworks and programming languages.

## Projects

There are many things I've been thinking about doing to give life to the Dÿkÿll language, not limited to:

- [] **Dÿkÿll – English Dictionary.**
- [] **Collection of Stories from the Dÿkkÿll people:** since there cannot be a language without its own culture and people, one of the projects will include a website with short stories about the *Dÿkkÿllioalle* or the people who speak Dÿkÿll.
- [] **Latin to Dÿkÿll script trasliterator tool.**
- [] **Dÿkÿll learning tool.**

## Technologies

I'll probably rely mostly on React and NodeJS at the beginning, as those are the technologies I feel more comfortable working with. However, one of the main goals of this repo is for me to play around different things, so I'll probably use other frameworks like Svelte or Vue as well as other languages other than JS like Elm or ReasonML. I'll expand this section as I decide which technologies to use and where.
The sky is the limit!
